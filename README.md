ALT (Active Learning and Teaching) is a mobile App that allows active learning through instant quizzes and feedback during lectures. The quizzes and feedback questions are given to students as part of the lecture without breaking the flow of the class. The students can respond on the app and the results are summarised by the app for the faculty to understand the state of class and engagement. The app aims to promote data privacy and security by storing minimal user information.
